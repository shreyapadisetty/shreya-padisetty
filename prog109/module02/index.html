    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In this module we learned how to create tables with headings and filling the cells.
       We also learned to create forms with user input areas either using a text box or 
       making the user select options.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>I felt more confident doing this because when I did the last assignment it
       wasn't as hard as I thought it would be and I had fun making this.</p>
