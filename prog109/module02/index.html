    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In this module we learned how to create tables with headings and filling the cells.
       We also learned to create forms with user input areas either using a text box or 
       making the user select options.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>When I looked at what we had to do for this module I saw that we had to make a chessboard.
       It looked hard to make in the beginning but it was fun to create it. </p>
