				 Before I took this class I actually took a class like this in high school. The teacher wasn't the best at 
					 teaching. I should've tried to learn by myself but I had no motivation to put in any effort.<br />
				 I took the class again and I really liked the way this teacher taught.<br />
				 I had already learned all the concepts but the class just helped me really understand the concepts. I also
					learned a new topic at the end. I believe understanding these concepts well is helping me in my CS211 class.</p>
