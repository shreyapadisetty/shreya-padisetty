    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In this module we learned the structure of html, how to style text, create lists,</p>
      <p>and add links and images.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>Before doing the practice and the assignment, I was overwhelmed by how I would do everything.</p>
      <p>Breaking it down and doing each task, I was able to see how easy it was compared to</p>
      <p>when I saw it as a whole.</p>
